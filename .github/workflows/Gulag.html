        <p>A gulag was a Soviet forced labor camp system. It was established in the early 1930s under Joseph Stalin's regime and was used to incarcerate political prisoners, criminals, and perceived enemies of the state. The conditions in the gulags were harsh and often deadly, with prisoners subjected to grueling labor, malnutrition, and severe punishments.</p>
        
        <p>The gulag system became a symbol of oppression and cruelty, with countless lives lost and families torn apart. The stories of the gulags serve as a reminder of the dark chapters in history and the importance of preserving human rights and dignity.</p>
